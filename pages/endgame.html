		Best marvel movie ever that ever existed and ever will exist, they literally created a masterpiece which brings so many years and movies to a close which was so full of emotion and cinematic beauty, as well as character development , time travel which is always fun and fat thor, which is the most hillarious joke after the previous movie, if you havent watched it yet you should, and if you have you should watch it again(one of those I watched 47 times...)
