		one of my favorite hobbies, the shower seems to be too short in my new apartment, or maybe a friend needs to build a new library for his wife's office, or just taking a few pieces of wood to create a coat hanger, this is what we spend our time doing when life allows us, me and my friends gather around someone's house and start sawing drilling screwing or simply beating up with a hammer we build whatever is needed sometimes creating inventions no one will use but having fun all along the way.
