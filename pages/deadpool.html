	<p>
		deadpool 2 is the second movie in the deadpool series, building off the first with the humour stupidity 4th wall breakings and the same silly nonesense that deadpool usually does, this time there's time travel more jokes about new villains and new heroes, a lot of suicide attempts and once again time travel, this is the best movie in the series in my opinion and is worth watching(even for the 73rd time I watche it ðŸ˜…)
