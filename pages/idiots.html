	<p>
		As the title says this book talks about something we all have in our minds one day or another, why is everyone so stupid? , well that question gets answered beautifully in his book Thomas brings years of research to discover why some people work better together whilst the rest have a hard time even holding a conversation together, bringing to the foreground the fact that people come in different well in this example colors, it gives people the advantage of handling people in the workplace and the world as well as your own family, this gives quite the perspective and teaches a lot of compassion, would totally recommend.
