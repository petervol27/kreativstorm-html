		Calisthenics is a form of training using mostly your bodyweight, the practice focuses mostly on push ups pull ups dips squats and hollow body holds, it trains the functionality of muscles as opposed to bodybuilding which focuses on aesthetics , this practice has been used widely by athletes all over the world for decades, I enjoy this form of training because I can do it anywhere at any time giving limitless options to keep my body healthy and strong, plus it's always cool to bet around with the boys and see who can do most pull ups
