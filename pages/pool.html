	<p>
		snooker/pool/billiards is a game played in a rectangle table with 6 holes, there are two sets of balls: striped or fully colored ones, a white ball and a black ball the eight ball as it's better known, you use a stick to hit the white ball so that it hits the other balls into the holes, the first player to put in all the balls either striped or fully colored and the black ball wins the game, its a game of skill and precision as well as creativity and luck, I enjoy playing it at least once a week with my friends spending time drinking some beer and training our precision skills as well as our capability under pressure when the end of the game begins.
