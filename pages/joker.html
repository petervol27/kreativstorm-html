	<p>
		The joker probably the best movie DC has ever created, technically the only one worth watching, but where they failed many times before they brought a masterpiece to the big screens, the character himself shows to be quite a problematic young man with horrible thoughts and heavy pain in his heart, as the story progresses he becomes more and more unhinged by the reality that is slowly unfolding before him, I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched and will say this, if they made the movie 6 hours long I would watch it twice in a row anyway
