	<p>
		chess is a board game that emulates war , giving each player an army to use so as to capture the opponent's king, the game can be simply played like I do with some friends family my nephews or online with other noobs who play for fun, or can be played for the competetion like world renowned chess players who play 500 moves ahead , which makes the games for total noobs quite harsh and unforgiving, the game itself teaches strategy and trains desiciveness, giving players limited time to consider all possible moves and to choose which move to make.
