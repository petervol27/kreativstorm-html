	<p>
		The 12 rules for life by Jordan Peterson is a self development book written by psychologist , Jordan B.Peterson, the book talks about lobsters and people as well as reality pain suffering happiness and purpose, it drives the point home that a meaningfull life will defeat the pain of suffering that is embedded in life itself for everyone of us, I recommend the book for everyone and anyone needing a little direction in life.
